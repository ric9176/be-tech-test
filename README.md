Using the following API endpoint: https://starwars.egghead.training/

Create your own API wrapper using the technologies and tools you feel most comfortable with. The API wrapper should provide the following endpoints:

	1. List all the Star Wars films using the format "{number} - {name}". Ideally, this should allow the user to specify the order of the list.
	2. List all the characters in a particular Star Wars film. The payload should only include the character name and image URL.
    
It would be nice to see a couple of unit tests for the endpoint so please feel free to use a TDD approach (or not!) :)
